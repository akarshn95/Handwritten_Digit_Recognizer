# Handwritten_Digit_Recognizer
Implemented a convolutional neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras to predict digits from MNSIT dataset of hand-written images. The model converts the 2D array of pixels into a 1D array and performs prediction using dense deep learning layers. It achieved an accuracy of 98.5%.
